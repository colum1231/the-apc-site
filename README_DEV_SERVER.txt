# DEV SERVER INSTRUCTIONS

Your Next.js app is located in the `web` subdirectory.

**To always run the dev server from the correct directory:**

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run:
   cd web
   npm run dev

This will ensure you are running the server from `/workspaces/the-apc-site/web`, where your `package.json` and `app` directory are located.

**If you want to run from the root (`/workspaces/the-apc-site`), you must move your `package.json` and all app files to the root.**

**Recommended:**
- Always run the dev server from the `web` directory for this project structure.
- Make sure your browser is visiting `http://localhost:3000` after starting the server.

If you want to restructure your project so you can run from the root, let me know and I can automate that for you.
